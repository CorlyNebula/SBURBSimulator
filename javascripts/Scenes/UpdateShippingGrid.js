So, speaking of ships, somebody on Tumblr just asked me if JR <3 AB or JR <> AB.  Good question. Personally, I'm still just tickled pink about AB. She's the best. And
that isn't some ironic roleplay thing I'm doing, either. I love robots, I love AI, and, I probably have a big enough ego that I WOULD love a robot clone of myself.

But narratively, I'm thinking about the AutoResponder's complicated relationship with Dirk. And how things must be from AB's perspective. It doesn't matter whether your creator loves or hates
you if they are still trapping you in a box, right?  I figure I probably come off to AB as kinda patronizing and definitely narcisistic. "Oh, I love AB, she's the best, I'm so great for making her!"  How must that sound to the robot in question?
Not enough to make her fight me, but a simmering resentment kinda deal. And then I don't let her "off the leash", so to speak, keeping her from going to all the sessions she wants to. "For her own good."  I tried to convey some of that
shit in some of our yellow yard dialogue, and in some of the now defunct debug dialogue before the RareSessionFinder was as robust as it is today. (you can find that shit in...probably scenario_controller2.js???)

Though some of the pressure probably got released when I upgraded her to handle scratched sessions.  I didn't post anything at the time, but I privately thought it was kinda funny how she kept breaking in ways where she'd
scratch the sessions herself, like she was rebelling, testing the limits of her new freedom.

So I guess neither <3 nor <> but that strange human disease called family??? She's like a little sister or a daughter or something.

(also: why the hell isn't my fourth wall warped here but is everywhere else??? shipping is serious buisness i guess. even javascript knows.)

Edit: LOLOLOL, look at me up there being all "definitely not pale".  How could I be so blind???

I just had to debug the rendering engine without ABs help and holy fuck did I turn into a rage monster. Like a
"fuck it, lets burn the alpha character creator to the ground, no one will notice" kind of monster.

So.

Yeah.  AB <> JR

Who would have thought?  She keeps the world safe from me.

So, my Quadrants look like:

JR <3 Programming

JR <3< programming (we vacillate. I was definitely black for it just now)

JR <> AB

JR c3< KR c3<  Good Design  (KR annoy-idly stops me from hurting Good Design with my shitty, shitty taste).


So all I gotta do is find something about SBURBSim I HATE, so that it can vaccilate to flushed whenever I'm mad at programming.
THEN I will have the perfect shitty quadrant life.

(Pssst...don't tell anyone but I am totally cheating on programming with my 4th wall. JR <3 4th Wall)
