            What is the Stone Aspect all about?
        </header>
        <body>
            The Aspect of Stone is widely regarded as one of the least prominent aspects due to its ability to have abstractions based upon other aspects. The job of those Stonebound is relatively simple; keeping the other aspects in one place, sort of like the “overseers” or “council members” of Paradox Space. It’s abstractions include Mind, Space, Power (Rage abstraction), Soul (Heart abstraction), Time, and Reality (Light abstraction).

            What are the Power Stone players?
        </header>
        <body>
            Those of the Power Stone can be characterized as considerably powerful and prominent. Power Stone users tend to used jujus such as soul capsules, making them all sorts of a problem; it gets worse due to the fact that the most prominent Power Stone classes are Bards and Thieves. Power Stone players have the ability to transform stones into a weapon.
