            What is the Stone Aspect all about?
        </header>
        <body>
            The Aspect of Stone is widely regarded as one of the least prominent aspects due to its ability to have abstractions based upon other aspects. The job of those Stonebound is relatively simple; keeping the other aspects in one place, sort of like the “overseers” or “council members” of Paradox Space. It’s abstractions include Mind, Space, Power (Rage abstraction), Soul (Heart abstraction), Time, and Reality (Light abstraction).

            What do the Space Stone players do?
        </header>
        <body>
            Under the Space abstraction the majority of them can be based on their expansive depth perception, sometimes being able to enter mirrors and modify them from the inside, acting as a sort of illusion to whoever gazes into the mirror, making it easy for Space Stone players to ambush an unexpecting “antagonist”. The more prominent classes for the Space Stone are the Maid and Knight.
