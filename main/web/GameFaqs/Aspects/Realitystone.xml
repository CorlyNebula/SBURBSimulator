            What is the Stone Aspect all about?
        </header>
        <body>
            The Aspect of Stone is widely regarded as one of the least prominent aspects due to its ability to have abstractions based upon other aspects. The job of those Stonebound is relatively simple; keeping the other aspects in one place, sort of like the “overseers” or “council members” of Paradox Space. It’s abstractions include Mind, Space, Power (Rage abstraction), Soul (Heart abstraction), Time, and Reality (Light abstraction).

            What does the Light Abstraction do?

            The Reality abstraction of the Stone aspect is seen to be one of the most annoying, mainly that of a “trickster god”, if I may. The Reality Stone members are either just or unjust with their actions and abuse within the universal limits, sometimes even breaking them - OR they can be just with their actions of the right or wrong within a session or group of sessions, and these Reality Stone users are often called Searchers, searching and scanning between sessions for evil threats to disturb the session. There are very few Searchers. Prominent classes include the Rogue and Page. The Reality Stone players can create illusions to distract others, but if said illusion is broken through, a crystalline trap will usually spring.
