            My friend seems to really like messing up the code of this game! What are they even doing? I don't understand!
        </header>
        <body>That is what tends to happen when people know enough about the game. Is your friend a Human? If so, really not surprised here. When somebody understands the programming behind SBURB, they really just can't resist trying to break it. Could you? That's what I thought.

            Hey, uh, I get the feeling that these FAQs are just sort of being thrown together randomly.

            Welcome to the wonderful world of meta. You enjoy being a Human, I take it?

            Why do all my consorts keep talking about the Cataclysm I am going to cause?

            Humans fuck shit up.  "Lay Human to" in other words.  Good luck trying to steer that shit into not fucking over your own party too much.

            Holy fuck I keep leveling up but all that happens is I get slightly better at strifes.  My friends are getting all sorts of weird abilities. What gives?

        <body>
            I'd bet you're a Human. Humans 'waste' their aspect, until it's time to 'lay waste with' it. Try to just enjoy it while it lasts, you'll be nostalgic for this shit before you know it.

            It seems that I have rolled Human. What should I do?

            Probably take a peek at the code. What could possibly go wrong?
