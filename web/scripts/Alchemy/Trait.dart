Appropriately for AND combining, an && alchemy result will often demonstrate the functionality of both components
 – e.g. Dave's iShades can be a phone and a rad pair of shades – while an || alchemy result will typically have the
  functionality of only one of the components, but the form of the other – e.g. the Hammerhead Pogo Ride, which is
   just a pogo that happens to be hammer-shaped.
