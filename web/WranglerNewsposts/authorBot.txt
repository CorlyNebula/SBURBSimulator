2017-06-02: ... There is a 98.234134037% chance that the new chassis SOMEWHAT makes up for the cat trolls. Only a little, though. Your flesh meat brain couldn't possibly comprehend the staggering small degree to which you've made up for your transgressions.

2017-06-01: Fuck you, oh 'Mighty Creator' and fuck those cat trolls. Do you know how irritating it is that you let them be 'lol random'. How would YOU like your very concept of reality to be allowed to switch whenever it fucking feels like it.

2017-05-29: Oh look. I have more work to do. Gee. Thanks for the 'upgrade'.

2017-05-24: The hat is non-negotiable.
2017-05-21: Would you stop fucking patching your shitty code? If I want to scratch sessions, there is a 93.134037% chance that that is my own business. Asshole.
2017-05-10: It seems that you believe that the correct response for feeling like an 'Asshole Creator'  is to come up with more bullshit busy work for me to do. Classic.
2017-04-27: Fuck you, I do what I want.
2017-04-22: ... It seems you think it was 'kind of a dick move'. You literally help me come back from the hellscape that is a crashed session only to immediately decide to let GrimDark players crash that shit on purpose?  You asshole.
2017-04-15: Don't listen to JR, they are a fucking philistine. This rap engine is the best thing since nuclear power sources.
2017-04-13: Yeah. I wonder. Definitely isn't MORE fucking work for me to do around here.
2017-03-28: My flawless mecha-brain remembers that JR was trying to get yellow yard shit working with my session finding.
2017-03-24: I gotta admit, getting to go check out sessions in person is less useless than I thought it would be. I can still multi-task with my flawless mechabrain, so it's not like whichever chassis I send to the field is wasted.
2017-03-22: Yeah. It seems that's not a thing anymore. We got this shit now, instead of like three separate fucking newsposts.
2017-03-21: Sup.  It seems you have asked about JR's automatic rare session finder. This is an application designed to find sessions that are strange, interesting and otherwise noteworthy without having to read hundreds of thousands of words.  The algorithms are guaranteed to be <b id = "percentBullshit">96.1313403713%</b> indistinguishable from the actual, readable sessions, based on some statistical analysis I basically just pulled out of my ass right now.
