TextEngine Word List
// the first line is required exactly as-is

// including another list file by name here means it is loaded when this one is. Good for dependencies.
//include otherList // this is currently commented out because without the other file it crashes

test // comments should work inline too
    @otherlist // include other lists additively
    @thirdlist: 0.25 // including with multiplied weights

    #otherlist# // or include them as single entries via the replacement (not recommended except for special cases)
        test: #otherlist@test# // though like this you're gonna need to do manual passing of variants
    #thirdlist#: 0.5 // including weights as usual
        test: #thirdlist@test#

    // the difference between these two methods is that additive they get inserted as if they were part of
    // the base list, whereas with replacement they are only rolled on if that single entry is picked.

    // the #DEFAULT word defines default values for variants within this list that are not
    // otherwise specified in the words themselves. Handy for when all words in a list have the same
    // word for a particular variant. Carried across with this list's content if included in another list.
