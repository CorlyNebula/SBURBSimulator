		<li>NAMES ARE COMPLETELY WRONG, will keep a name word even if the trait is lost. THIS IS BAD. Also I think there is glitches.</li>
		<li> traits aren't always right? Like, yeah, Smart Metal Fiduspawn Plush only gives Cozy when it's used as material?</li>
		<li> Grist hoard. Alchemy has grist cost (how?)
		<li>When item hits max upgrades, remove from list?</li>
		<li>consider letting an item have exactly one "material" and one "form" (i.e. metal hammer)</li>
		<li> ability to buy new items with diff properties</li>
		<li> Achievements (think little inferno), get you $$$.  ((Also test meme names. Like Glowy Burny Sword = Light Saber. Electric Guitar.))
		<li> Plot???</li>
		<li>rewards (should xor be a thing to begin with?)</li>
		<br><br>
		<h1>Test Cases: Conclusion: Working as intended. (So what the fuck was going on with traits before? Do i need to deeper? three x combo?)</h1>
		<li>Pistol AND Sword = Pointed Pistol, shooty,metal,a pistol,edged,pointy,a sword</li>
		<li>Sword AND Pistol =  A Pistol Sword ,edged,metal,pointy,a sword,shooty,a pistol</li>
		<li>Pistol OR Sword = A Sword Pistol, ,shooty,metal,a sword</li>
		<li>Sword OR Pistol = A Pistol Sword, ,edged,pointy,metal,a pistol</li>
		<li>Pistol XOR Sword = Pointed Pistol, shooty,a pistol,edged,pointy,a sword</li>
		<li>Sword XOR Pistol = A Pistol Sword, edged,pointy,a sword,shooty,a pistol </li>
		<li>Pointed Pistol (from AND) AND Whip = Fabric Pistol, ,shooty,metal,a pistol,restraining,cloth,a whip </li>
		<li>Whip AND Pointed Pistol (from AND) = Metal Whip, ,restraining,cloth,a whip,shooty,metal,a pistol</li>
		<li> CLAWS AND ((Pistol AND Sword) AND WHIP) = Metal Claws, edged,bone,claws,shooty,metal,a pistol , <h1> Yessssss it finally fucks up. BUT WHY???</h1></li>
