        My friend seems to really like messing up the code of this game! What are they even doing? I don't understand!

    <body>That is what tends to happen when people know enough about the game. Is your friend a Waste? If so, really not surprised here. When somebody understands the programming behind SBURB, they really just can't resist trying to break it. Could you? That's what I thought.
