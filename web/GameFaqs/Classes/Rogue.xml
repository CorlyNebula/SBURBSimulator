            Dear Duthulu! Yes! Rouges are awesome! Rogues are universally sexy and adventurous and always totally adorable! You are now literally Robin Hood, but better! You steal shit from the various horrible monsters and incomprehensible forces in your session then give them to others! You are legitimately a smuggler of magic, you're Han Solo, but magic! Your Aspect determines what goods you steal and redistribute, but regardless of your Aspect you'll get really cool powers! Anyway, Rogues are awesome!
