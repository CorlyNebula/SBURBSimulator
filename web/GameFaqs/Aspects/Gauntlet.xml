            What is the Stone Aspect all about?
        </header>
        <body>
            The Aspect of Stone is widely regarded as one of the least prominent aspects due to its ability to have abstractions based upon other aspects. The job of those Stonebound is relatively simple; keeping the other aspects in one place, sort of like the “overseers” or “council members” of Paradox Space. It’s abstractions include Mind, Space, Power (Rage abstraction), Soul (Heart abstraction), Time, and Reality (Light abstraction).

            How exactly does this fit into the Stone Aspect?
        </header>

            Another fable told of the Stone members is of their defeat, in which they turn into stones of their corresponding power, and with every one of each abstractions defeated rises a Muse and Lord of Stones, who are meant to contain those he/she was birthed from defeat of. The Muse and Lord will often duel for these stones, the Muse acting as if an Active to counter a strangely passive Lord’s searches. Neither of the two can be defeated in any way until one of the two has found the stones they have searched for, in which the one who has failed their mission becomes a container for the other’s stones, whether in the shape of a weapon or of a planet. Some who have found them all have requested to keep the opposing living as a lover or as a companion in their future journeys. The Lords and Muses have the ability to detect the stones they require. Let’s be honest, they kind of act like cherubs.
