            Question: I am the Blood player! What does that mean?

            Congratulations, you won the Skaian lottery ticket of bullshit and suffering to earn yourself your
            co-players falling under your jurisdication. Hope you like human interaction, because that is your life now.
            You get to do FUN activities such as dealing with other people's shit for an extended period of time, telling
            people to stop being such childish, pants pooping weenies, and being their personal caretaker, wow, fun.
            Make sure YOU keep their mental health stable, because we ALL know the psyche is such an easy thing to
            understand! You will be blamed for everything un-hinging off the fucking methaporical bullshit rotating door
            that is Sburb. Everything is suffering and pain, and that is in a sense literally what being a Blood player is all
            about. Truly, fuck you and your life. Welcome to Sburb, Hero of Blood, it does not take you kindly, but it is YOUR job to tell it to fuck off.
