            What is the Stone Aspect all about?
        </header>
        <body>
            The Aspect of Stone is widely regarded as one of the least prominent aspects due to its ability to have abstractions based upon other aspects. The job of those Stonebound is relatively simple; keeping the other aspects in one place, sort of like the “overseers” or “council members” of Paradox Space. It’s abstractions include Mind, Space, Power (Rage abstraction), Soul (Heart abstraction), Time, and Reality (Light abstraction).

            What does the Soul Abstraction do?
        </header>
        <body>
            The bearers of the Soul abstraction are summed up through their bad doings and superstition which eventually led to their past downfall. Soul members are often seen as quite disassociative to others, as the next second they are slaughtering dozens, the next second they are mourning. Prominent classes of the Soul abstraction are Princes and Witches. Soul Stone players have the ability to transform themselves into titans of crystalline or crystal objects.
